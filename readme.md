#Paramour
>Can you win the affection of your beloved? 
>Play this game and find out if you win the affections 
> of the amazing HUNK!

###Introduction:
There are many rituals that we go through in our culture. Few are as complex as the ritual of falling in love and finding your paramour. See if you can complete the rituals to win the affection of your beloved! This will be a 2-4 player boardgame/computer fusion. Each player will play the role of a person seeking affection. The dating rituals involve going out to eat, going out the movies, participating in common activities. All the while, each player will be trying to learn the randomly chosen details of their paramour. As a player learns more they will be better able to navigate the relationship and progress towards the ultimate ritual, the ultimate goal, getting married.
